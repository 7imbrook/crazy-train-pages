The Voices in Software Engineering (ViSE) committee connect industry and academic professionals to local students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Experts in the field of Software Engineering are invited to the Society of Software Engineers to speak and interact with students of all disciplines. These topics, ranging from the history of C++ to using technology to combat social injustices, are geared to expand oneâ€™s interest in both Software Engineering and the field of computing in general.

All talks are free and open to all. With consent of the speaker, recordings of each talk are posted online.

* Eric Bauer (Author, _Practical System Reliability_)
* Kyle Shank (Co-Founder/Developer, RadRails)
