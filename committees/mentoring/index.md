Mentoring Lab
-------------

One of the most visible and popular resources of the SSE, the mentoring lab
is located in room 1670 in the Golisano College of Computing and Information
Sciences. The lab's official hours are 10 AM to 6 PM, during which there is
always one or more mentors on duty to help students of any major with any
topic that relates to software engineering.

The mentoring schedule for the week is available at: <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?title=Mentoring%20Schedule&mode=WEEK&height=768&wkst=1&bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&src=ict76b9u2j4ogt6r3spab08vog%40group.calendar.google.com&color=%232F6213&ctz=America%2FNew_York" target="_blank">SSE Mentoring Schedule</a>

The mentoring lab is a great place for all students to relax, socialize,
work, and get help throughout the day.

Mentors
-------

SSE mentors are all volunteers, students who have finished important
courses in the software engineering curriculum and want to help their peers
succeed. Mentors are usually on duty during two 2-hour blocks during the week,
where they're available to answer questions and assist students who need help
with coursework, projects, or software engineering in general.

All mentors have, at a minimum, completed the introductory CS sequence and
4010-361 Software Engineering.  Many are upperclassmen who have completed
multiple co-op blocks, and have great advice for students looking to choose
courses or find companies for the rest of their academic careers.

Review Sessions
---------------

The SSE holds roughly a dozen review sessions for multiple courses in the CS
and SE departments every quarter. Before each review, a team of mentors that
have already taken the class builds a practice test for students to work
through. After working on the test on their own and with other students, the
mentors go over each question on the practice exam, discussing answers and
providing hints on what to expect on the test.

Review sessions are one of the most successful parts of the SSE's mentoring
efforts, with over 100 students at some reviews.

Crash Courses
-------------

While [Tech Talks][1] are designed to give students who have learned
something a chance to share it, [Crash Courses][2] are given when a member wants to
learn a new technology or technique and we have people who can teach them. Crash
courses are usually scheduled by request, although we do work with the
[Projects Committee][3] to prepare for Rapid Development Weekend.
