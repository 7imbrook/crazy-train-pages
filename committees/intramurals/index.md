A well-rounded individual is important to the SSE and as such we participate in
many intramural sports. For example some quarters the SSE participates in
Ultimate Frisbee, dodge ball and soccer. On top of the intramurals the committee
is also responsible for organizing additional events like weekly gym sessions
and additional pick-up games. This breeds a little healthy competition and
promotes fitness.
