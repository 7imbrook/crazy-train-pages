If you're interested in getting your hands on some SSE-brand apparel, the
Fundraising committee is who you will want to talk to.

The following things and more can be purchased from the fundraising committee or
any mentor on duty:

* T-shirts
* Polos
* Zip-up hoodies
* Stickers
* Padfolios
* Ties

In addition to branded apparel, the fundraising committee also accepts donations
for candy and soda available in the lab.

Your donations help keep the SSE in business by allowing other committees to
purchase books or subsidize events for members.

If you have questions about fundraising, you can contact
