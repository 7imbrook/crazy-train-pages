If you're interested in getting your hands on some SSE-brand apparel, the
Fundraising committee is who you will want to talk to.

The following things and more can be purchased from the fundraising committee or
any mentor on duty:

* Old Style T-shirt (SSE across the front and SSE Logo with Stick man on back) in Small and Medium.
* New Style T-shirts (SSE Logo on front surrounded by circle) in Men’s Small, XL and 2XL, and Women’s Small, Medium, Large and XL.
* Polos in Small and Large
* Stickers of the SSE Logo
* Padfolios
* Ties
* SE Drawstring Bags
* New SSE Mugs
* And More.

In addition to branded apparel, the fundraising committee also accepts donations
for candy and soda available in the lab.

Your donations help keep the SSE in business by allowing other committees to
purchase books or subsidize events for members.
